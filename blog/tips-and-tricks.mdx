## Time Management

<Tip>
  **The 80/20 Rule**: Focus 80% of your study time on the 20% of material that will have the biggest impact on your grades.
</Tip>

### Weekly Planning
1. **Sunday**: Plan the upcoming week
2. **Daily**: Review and adjust daily goals
3. **Friday**: Reflect on weekly progress
4. **Buffer time**: Leave 20% for unexpected tasks

### Exam Preparation
- Start studying 2-3 weeks before major exams
- Create a study timeline working backwards from exam date
- Practice with past exams or sample questions
- Form study groups for accountability and discussion

<Warning>
  Avoid cramming the night before exams. Distributed practice over time is far more effective for retention.
