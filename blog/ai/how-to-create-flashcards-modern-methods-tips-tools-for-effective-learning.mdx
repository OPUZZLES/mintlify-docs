Creating flashcards is one of the most proven learning strategies for students, pupils and anyone who wants to acquire knowledge in the long term. **Learning cards** (a synonym for flashcards) support **active recall** and use **spaced repetition** to transfer new knowledge into long-term memory. In this comprehensive guide, we show you how to create and use flashcards efficiently today, whether they are classic paper cards or **digital flashcards**. We cover both traditional approaches and modern technologies, from **flashcard apps** like Anki, Quizlet or StudySmarter to AI-powered tools like ~~EducateAI~~ or specialised programs that can **automatically create** flashcards for you. Our goal is not only to provide you with information that is optimised for search engines, but above all to give you real added value in terms of content – with practical tips on design, learning psychology and suitable methods for different types of learners.

## **Why learn with flashcards? The advantages of the flashcard method**

Learning with flashcards has been proven for generations for good reason. For one thing, flashcards promote the **active recall** of information: Instead of just passively reading the material, you have to retrieve the answer from memory – a process that significantly increases learning success (~~Active Recall: Techniques & Benefits | Vaia~~). Educational experts call this *Active Recall*, and it is demonstrably one of the most effective learning techniques: Active recall helps to consolidate knowledge, which increases the **retention rate** in the long term (~~Active Recall: Techniques & Benefits | Vaia~~).

On the other hand, index cards make it easy to implement principles of **learning psychology**. In particular, **spaced repetition** (distributed repetition) is virtually ‘built into’ the index card method. Here, repetitions are stretched over increasing time intervals to counteract natural forgetting (~~spaced repetition – Wikipedia~~). The idea behind this is that We learn more sustainably if we repeat content over a longer period of time instead of **cramming** everything in a short period of time (~~Spaced Repetition – Wikipedia~~). In fact, without repetition, a large part of newly acquired knowledge is lost within a few days – the famous *Ebbinghaus forgetting curve* shows that after just one day, only around **34%** of what has been learned is remembered (~~Forgetting Curve – Wikipedia~~). However, this curve can be flattened with planned repetition. Spaced repetition is so effective that it has been proven by over 80 years of research and is constantly being refined (~~What is the evidence around spaced repetition | SC Training~~). Modern learning software automatically uses this principle, but it can also be implemented manually with index boxes (more on this later).

In addition to active recall and spaced repetition, flashcard learning offers other advantages: it is **flexible** – you can go through a few cards anywhere – and it promotes *bite-sized learning*. Complex material is broken down into small units of knowledge (question-and-answer cards), which makes learning less overwhelming. In addition, flashcards allow you to set your own **learning pace**: you review difficult cards more often and simple ones less often. The result is a highly efficient, personalised learning system that allows you to remember even abstract or extensive content in the long term.

## **Analogue or digital? Classic vs. modern flashcards**

Before we get into the digital tools, it's worth making a brief comparison: **analogue flashcards** made of paper versus **digital flashcards** on a smartphone or PC. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages – and often a combination is ideal.

**Analogue flashcards** (i.e. written cards made of cardboard) have the charm of **haptic learning**. Many students appreciate **writing down** content by hand because this motor process activates memory even more (~~learning myths: Does writing by hand make you smarter?~~). Studies actually show that handwritten notes or index cards lead to better memory performance due to the active movement of the hand and arm (~~learning myths: Does writing by hand make you smarter?~~). You see, feel and write what you have learned – several senses are addressed. Especially **kinesthetic learners** benefit from this: when you do something while learning (e.g. writing on cards, stacking, turning over), the material often sticks better than when you just read it. In addition, there are no technical distractions with physical cards – no screen to distract you, no notifications. Some also enjoy the visual sorting: you can spread cards out on the table, group them, mark them with colours, etc. This tangible component gives many a stronger sense of control over the learning material.

On the other hand, analogue flashcards are more difficult to use. If you have a few hundred cards, **organising and repeating** them by hand can quickly become confusing. The classic **Leitner system** helps here – an index box with several compartments into which you put known cards at the back and unknown cards at the front (~~Learning card index – Wikipedia~~). This system ensures that difficult cards appear more often and familiar ones less often. However, even the best box reaches its limits with a large number of cards. In addition, manual repetition requires discipline: you have to decide for yourself when to review which card.

**Digital flashcards** solve many of these problems. In an **app**, the program takes over the scheduling: algorithms analyse your responses and calculate the optimal repetition time for each card (~~Background - Anki Manual~~). This way, you won't forget anything because the app shows you the card again exactly when it's needed – at ever-increasing intervals as long as you know it. This saves a lot of time and effort. Popular apps like Anki have long relied on the SuperMemo algorithm (SM-2), a proven spaced repetition algorithm (~~Background - Anki Manual~~). In addition, digital tools offer further advantages: **Multimedia content** (images, audio) can be easily integrated, which is particularly beneficial for **visual or auditory learners**. For example, you can add an image or audio pronunciation to a vocabulary card. It's also easier to **search and sort** – you can find any card in seconds using a keyword search. And don't forget: digital cards are **available everywhere**. You always have them with you on your phone, so you can use waiting times to study and you don't have to carry around a stack of paper.

However, with digital solutions, some of the haptic component is lost. Some people lack the feeling of really having *created* something when they just type instead of writing. A middle way can help here: many swear by first **writing index cards by hand** to absorb the learning material, and then digitally mapping it to manage the repetition automatically. So it's not an either/or. What's important is that you choose the method that works best for **you personally** – and that can vary depending on your learning style. In the next step, we'll look at the modern tools available to you to combine the best of both worlds.

## **Create flashcards with AI: breaking new ground with artificial intelligence**

Perhaps the most exciting development in recent times is the use of **artificial intelligence (AI)** to create flashcards. AI-powered tools can do a lot of the work for you by automatically generating suggested questions and answers from existing learning materials. A prime example is *EducateAI*, an AI learning assistant designed specifically for this scenario. According to the provider, EducateAI generates **personalised flashcards** from your uploaded scripts or texts and optimises your learning plan with an intelligent spaced repetition system (~~Start Studying Smarter not harder with EducateAi~~). In principle, it works like a digital tutor: you get automatically generated questions about your subject matter, clear explanations and a dynamic repetition interval that adapts to your learning progress (~~Start Studying Smarter not harder with EducateAi~~).

The benefits are clear: instead of spending hours formulating flashcards yourself, you can use AI to **create flashcards faster** and focus on learning. Modern AI models analyse texts, find the important facts or concepts and use them to formulate quiz questions or definitions. Some tools go even further and offer interactive queries or explanations. This not only saves time, but can also improve the quality of the flashcards – for example, by ensuring that important relationships are not forgotten. One provider of AI flashcards reports that such automatic creation can increase learning productivity by **30%** (~~Flashcards AI | Study Fetch | The Best AI tools for Learning | StudyFetch~~).

How does it work exactly? Let's assume you have lecture notes or a chapter from a textbook in PDF format. An AI-based tool can read this document and extract the key points using natural language processing. It then generates question-answer pairs from this. Example: The text says ‘Mitosis is the process of cell nuclear division in eukaryotes.’ The AI could then create the index card from this: *question:* ‘What is mitosis?’ – *answer:* ‘The process of cell nuclear division in eukaryotic cells.’ There are now several such automated systems. EducateAI is one of them, another is called *retain.cards*, which we would like to mention as an example: there it says that you can simply upload a PDF or even a photo of notes, and the AI creates matching index cards in seconds – from formatted text to formulas to handwritten notes (~~Retain – Study in record time~~). This technology is still under development, but it is improving rapidly.

For you as a student, this means that **creating flashcards with AI** can be a huge relief, especially when time is short or you have a lot of material. However, it is important to always critically review the automatically created cards. An AI can sometimes ask irrelevant details or formulate the question unhappily. It is designed to support you, not replace you. Often the best approach is to use AI cards as a **basis** and then manually improve them: adjust unclear formulations, add additional examples or delete cards that you don't need. This way, you can quickly create a custom set of cards that is tailored to your learning material.

AI can also facilitate the **training of comprehension questions**. Some systems (such as newer functions of ChatGPT or other large language models) allow you to simply enter a command like ‘Create 10 flashcards on topic XYZ’ – and you'll get a list of questions and answers in seconds. You can then import these into your preferred app. The integration of AI into learning platforms is still in its infancy, but tools like EducateAI show where the journey is headed: to a learning process that is *adaptive* and *personalised*, with routine tasks such as card creation being automated.

## **Popular flashcard apps: Anki, Quizlet, EducateAi & Co.**

If you want to learn digitally, you are spoilt for choice – there are numerous **apps and platforms for flashcards**. In German-speaking countries, three names are particularly well known: **Anki**, **Quizlet** and **StudySmarter** (the latter has been called *Vaia* since 2023). Each of these applications has its own approach and special strengths. Let's take a look at them:

### **Anki – The classic with spaced repetition**

Anki is one of the oldest and most powerful flashcard apps out there. Originally started as an open-source project, Anki has earned a reputation as an *efficient learning machine*. What makes Anki special is that it consistently uses a sophisticated **spaced repetition algorithm** (based on SuperMemo SM-2) (~~Background - Anki Manual~~). After each answer, you give feedback on how well you knew the card (e.g. *‘good’*, *‘hard’* or *‘not known’*), and the app automatically calculates when this card is due next – be it in 10 minutes, 1 day or not for several weeks. This way, Anki ensures that you review each piece of information exactly when you need to, **before you** forget it, and extends the intervals further and further as you master the card. The result is a highly optimised learning plan with no effort on your part.

(~~File:Anki 2.1.6 screenshot.png - Wikimedia Commons~~) *Example screenshot of the Anki app. The software uses coloured buttons (below) to assess knowledge and plans the next repetition interval based on this (e.g. in 1 day or 4 days). Anki thus dynamically adapts to your learning success.* (~~Background - Anki Manual~~)

Anki is available across platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS – although the iOS app is subject to a fee) and is particularly popular among students. You can either **create your own flashcards** or access a huge pool of public decks shared by the community. There are many ready-made decks for subjects such as medicine, languages or exam questions. Anki is extremely flexible: cards can include images, LaTeX formulas, audio; you can organise cards into different **tags/categories**, and there are numerous add-ons for special functions. However, this power also has a downside: the user interface appears somewhat sober and technical, which can be difficult for beginners at the beginning. But for those who do invest the time to learn how to use it, Anki is a **free tool** that can be used to master practically any subject. Anki embodies the motto ‘Study smarter, not harder’ in its purest form. It's no wonder that many consider it to be **the best flashcard app** for ambitious learners.

### **Quizlet – flashcards and games in the community**

**Quizlet** is another giant among learning apps, particularly popular for schools and languages. Unlike Anki, which is primarily focused on individual users, Quizlet sees itself as an **online learning platform** where users share millions of flashcard sets. According to Wikipedia, Quizlet has over 300 million sets created by users and more than 50 million active learners worldwide (~~Quizlet – Wikipedia~~). The basic idea is that you search for a topic – you can often find ready-made flashcards on it that others have created – or you can create your own flashcards and optionally make them available to the public. This results in collaborative learning: for example, many students use shared Quizlet sets to prepare for their school-leaving exams or for vocabulary training.

Quizlet is characterised by its **playful learning modes**. In addition to the classic flashcard mode, there are options such as *matching* (a time-based game in which you have to quickly combine terms and definitions), generating tests (Quizlet creates a small quiz from your cards) or **Quizlet Live**, a multiplayer classic game in which teams compete against each other. These gamification elements make learning more varied and motivating. For visual learners, it's handy that you can **add images to cards** on Quizlet (limited number for free accounts). There's also an audio function: words can be spoken automatically, which is ideal for language learning.

A big plus is that Quizlet is available on all platforms: it runs in the browser and as an app. So you can create flashcards on your PC and study on the go on your phone. The basic functions are free, but there is a subscription (*Quizlet Plus*) that allows you to study offline, view advanced statistics, or use **AI learning aids** (the so-called ‘Q-Chat’). However, the free version is sufficient for most people. Quizlet also relies on repetition techniques, but not as strictly algorithmically as Anki – it leaves it up to you to decide which modes you use and when. Thanks to its huge community and ease of use, Quizlet is an excellent place to get started quickly and find flashcards in practically any subject area.

### EducateAI – AI-supported flashcard creation

**EducateAI** is changing the game in the world of digital flashcards. Unlike traditional apps that focus on manual card creation – such as **Anki** with its proven spaced repetition system or **Quizlet** with its huge community – EducateAI uses artificial intelligence to take care of the entire creation process for you. With EducateAI, you can upload learning materials, PDFs or lecture notes, and the tool automatically generates personalised flashcards. It extracts relevant content, converts it into question-and-answer formats and even suggests suitable repetition intervals. This way, you get a tailor-made set of flashcards that dynamically adapts to your learning progress. EducateAI combines cutting-edge AI technology with didactic best practices, so you not only save time but also learn more efficiently – ideal for anyone who wants to learn smarter, not harder.

### **More tools and apps**

Besides the ‘big three’, there are of course many more **flashcard tools**. Some examples:

- **Brainyoo**: A German flashcard software that offers not only classic cards but also a learning mode for exam questions. Popular for exam preparation.
- **Cram** (formerly known as Flashcard Exchange): Online platform similar to Quizlet with thousands of public sets.
- **Memrise**: Designed specifically for language learning, it combines flashcards with mnemonic tricks and short videos by native speakers.
- **Brainscape**: an app that uses its own 5-level confidence-based system; more available in English.
- **Quizlet alternatives** such as *Chegg Prep*, *Flashcards Deluxe*, *RemNote* (the latter combines notes with flashcards, similar to Roam Research).

Each has its niche – but basically they all serve the same purpose: they help you to learn knowledge in small portions and to repeat it over time. Feel free to try out different apps and see which one you feel most comfortable with. The important thing is **that you study with flashcards at all**, not in which app. The best app is the one you use regularly!

## **Collaborative learning: create and share flashcards together**

A major advantage of digital platforms is the ability to **work together on flashcards**. In study groups or school classes, you can divide up the creation of flashcards: each person works on a chapter, and at the end you have a comprehensive set of cards for the whole subject. Tools like Quizlet or StudySmarter make sharing easy – a link is all you need to give classmates access to the set. Some apps even allow simultaneous editing. This is how a ‘shared knowledge database’ is created.

Collaborative creation has several advantages: firstly, it saves time for the individual; secondly, everyone benefits from each other's areas of knowledge (maybe your fellow student has a brilliant mnemonic for exactly the definition you are struggling with); and thirdly, it motivates you – a little group pressure can help you stay on the ball. However, you should always keep an eye on quality: agree on how you formulate questions and what depth you are aiming for so that the cards are consistent. It is also worth **checking each other's flashcards**. Meet up (offline or online) and quiz each other with your cards. This often helps you to see where there is room for improvement and you can discuss the material – which in turn increases the learning effect.

A special case of sharing are **public flashcard libraries**. With both Quizlet and StudySmarter (and others), you can search by keyword and, with a bit of luck, find pre-made sets on your topic. This is tempting, but be careful: not every publicly available card is correct or at your desired level. It's best to use other people's card sets as a basis that you can customise. Many learners report that even **revising other people's cards** helps them learn because they actively engage with the material instead of just adopting it.

To summarise: use the *power of the community*, but think critically. Learning together is fun and can be very efficient as long as everyone pulls together. And don't forget, in the end, everyone learns for themselves – your friend's flashcard is only useful if you

## **Automatically generate flashcards from texts or PDFs**

One exciting aspect of modern learning technology is the ability to **create flashcards automatically from existing content.** We have already seen in the section on AI tools that artificial intelligence can help with this. But even without in-depth knowledge of AI, some programs offer simple automatisms: for example, **importing highlights from PDFs**. Imagine you have marked important sentences in your digital script – some apps can read these highlights and automatically formulate them as question-and-answer cards. Or you can use a service where you just upload a document and a few seconds later you get a complete set of flashcards as a result.

In fact, there are already a number of specialised services for this. The aforementioned *retain.cards*, for example, advertises exactly this: *‘Upload your PDF or image and our AI will create flashcards in seconds – from text and formulas to images and handwritten notes.’* (~~Retain – study in record time~~). A user on Reddit has also presented a project where you can upload a photo or screenshot and flashcards are generated directly from it (~~Automatically create flashcards from an image. : r/GetStudying~~). Such functions are invaluable if you have lecture slides, for example – each slide could become a question (‘What does XYZ stand for?’, ‘What does slide 10 say?’ etc.).

Another approach is to use **plugins or add-ons**: for Anki, for example, there are extensions that allow you to automatically generate flashcards from digital textbooks or create flashcards from a vocabulary list. OCR technology (optical character recognition) can also help: if you have a book as an image, software can recognise the text and convert it into flashcards. The line between these tools and real AI solutions is blurred – often, machine learning algorithms are also behind them, for example, to suggest the most important sentence of a paragraph as an answer.

For you as a learner, this means above all: **don't be afraid to use little helpers!** It's not ‘cheating’ to take some of the work off your hands when creating the cards. The important thing is the learning itself. If an automatic generation provides you with a first batch of cards, all the better. You can still intervene manually, edit or delete cards that don't fit. The goal is to end up with a stack of high-quality cards – the path to get there can be convenient. Nevertheless, you should remain realistic: not every subject is equally suitable. Interpreting a poem or neatly casting a complex comprehension question in Q&A still overwhelms current automatic systems. But for factual knowledge, definitions of terms, vocabulary or simple comprehension questions, automatic flashcard generators are already a huge help.

## **Tips for structuring and designing effective flashcards**

Whether you write your flashcards by hand, type them in an app, or have them created automatically, the **quality of the cards** is crucial to how well you learn with them. Here are some **best practices** for designing truly effective flashcards:

- **One card = one fact/term:** Keep it short! Ideally, each flashcard should only ask *one question or define one term*. Instead of writing an entire paragraph as an answer, break the material down. Multiple small cards are better than one overloaded one. Example: Instead of ‘Explain Chapter 3 in full,’ create multiple cards on individual concepts from Chapter 3. This way, you know exactly what you know and don't know when you review.
- **Clear prompt:** Formulate the front page precisely. Avoid giving too much context on the question side, but provide enough information so that you know what is being asked. For example, don't just write ‘Definition?’ but ‘Definition: osmosis’. If you learn well with cloze texts, you can also use cloze cards (e.g. ‘The capital of France is **[...]**’).
- **Comprehensible answers:** On the back (answer page), you should write the solution briefly and clearly. Whole sentences are often good because they provide context. If there are technical terms in them, explain them briefly in brackets. You can also add examples to help comprehension. Important: The answer must be exactly what the question wants – not more and not something else. Otherwise, you may end up not reviewing what you actually wanted to learn.
- **Images and mnemonics:** **visual learners** benefit enormously from images or graphics on cards. For example, if you want to remember a muscle in anatomy, insert an image of it and highlight it. Diagrams or mind map sections can also help to reduce complex relationships to the essentials. **Mnemonics** (memory tricks) are also invaluable: if you have a creative mnemonic (e.g. a play on words), feel free to add it to the card – preferably on the answer side, so that you come across it when reviewing and it makes remembering easier.
- **Categorise and colour code:** It's worth structuring your cards, especially if you have a lot of them. Whether you use analogue coloured index cards (e.g. yellow for terms, green for people, blue for dates) or digital tags and folders, sorting them will help you keep track of them. It also allows you to practice specific categories (e.g. go over all the formulas again before the maths exam).
- **Language and style:** Write the cards in your **own words**. The brain remembers self-formulated sentences better than memorised definitions from the textbook. Keep the language simple and clear. You are learning for yourself, not for a beauty contest – so it's okay if a term is explained in colloquial language, as long as you understand it. But avoid ambiguity. If a term has multiple meanings, you may want to write a note about what is required (‘Chemistry: *atomic orbital* - definition?’ so that you don't give the meaning in a different context).
- **Typeface:** If you are working with physical cards, make sure they are **legible**. Nothing is more frustrating than not being able to decipher your own claw. Write large enough and neatly, or print them out if necessary (there are templates in Word for index cards that you can then cut). Digitally, you don't have this problem; it's more about layout: use bullet points or paragraphs to structure information, rather than a sausage of text.

One more tip: **Revise your cards as you learn.** It is completely normal to realise while revising that a card was badly placed (‘the question is unclear’) or that you keep failing the same card because the answer is not explained well enough. Don't be afraid to correct such cards! The flashcards are a living document of your learning. By adapting them, you actively process the material again – which in itself has a learning effect.

Finally: quality comes before quantity. There is little point in blindly combining 1000 flashcards if you never review them or half of them miss the mark. It's better to have 200 well-made cards that you really work through and understand. Remember, flashcards are just a **tool** – the actual learning happens in your head. So make it as easy as possible for yourself by designing the cards effectively.

## **Print flashcards and use them offline**

Even though digital solutions dominate, many learners continue to swear by **printed flashcards**. And there are indeed cases in which the haptic experience or simply the independence from devices is an advantage. Fortunately, the analogue and digital worlds don't have to be mutually exclusive – many apps offer functions to print index cards.

The simplest option is to export your digital cards as a PDF or text file and print them as a list. Some tools (e.g. StudySmarter) have special print layouts in which questions and answers are arranged next to each other or on the front and back pages. There are also templates for printing digital cards directly in card format (you usually still have to cut them out). If you have a lot of cards, it can be useful to use a **mail merge** in Word or LaTeX to create nicely formatted card templates – but this is more for perfectionists. For most purposes, normal text is sufficient: you cut the paper in half – question at the top, answer at the bottom – and glue the pages together or use blank index cards to stick them on.

But why print at all? For one thing, as mentioned, because of the **motor component**: grasping and turning over can help with learning. Some people arrange heavy cards on the table in front of them and sort them to see their learning progress. On the other hand, with paper cards you are completely **independent of technology**. No battery, no internet – you can study in the park without being distracted, or at bedtime without screen light. For younger students, physical cards are often more tangible, more playful (you can play memory with them, etc.). And if you ever have exams where you are not allowed to take anything digital with you, printed cheat sheets in card format can be helpful in your preparation.

Another point: **kinesthetic learning**. There are learners who remember things better when they write and handle them (as mentioned above with handwriting). If you find that typing is not enough for you, you might consider creating at least some of your cards by hand. Some people do it this way: they write down important, difficult cards on paper again, as a kind of ‘master card’. When writing, you sort your thoughts again and anchor the knowledge more deeply (~~learning myths: Does handwriting make you smarter?~~). Handwriting has a certain learning effect in itself – according to a Princeton study, students remember handwritten content better than typed content (~~learning myths: Does handwriting make you smarter?~~). This principle can also be applied to index cards.

(~~image~~) *Classic index cards on a ring: Printed or handwritten flashcards can also be organised practically – here with a card index ring. Many students today combine digital creation with analogue use to benefit from both worlds.*

If you are planning a large print run, you might want to invest in a slightly thicker paper or even blank index cards that you can print on (some printers can feed A6 cards directly). Alternatively, you can print 4 cards per A4 sheet and cut them. There are also online services where you can have sets of index cards professionally printed if it is something very extensive (but this is usually only worthwhile for companies or lecturers who distribute cards to many people).

Ultimately, it's a matter of taste. See if you learn better with physical cards or if it doesn't make much of a difference. Some learners also switch depending on the phase: in the **development phase**, they create cards digitally (faster, more convenient), in the **revision phase** before exams, they print them out and go through them offline to get away from the screen. Do what gives you the most confidence in what you've learned!

## **Best practices from learning psychology: how to use spaced repetition and active recall**

We've already learned about the concepts of **spaced repetition** and **active recall** – they are at the heart of successful flashcard learning. Here, we'll take a closer look at **how** you can implement these principles in your everyday life.

**Active recall** means questioning yourself instead of just passively reading. By using flashcards, you automatically do this with each card: you see the question and **search your memory** for the answer. It's important to be honest with yourself. Don't reveal the answer too soon – struggle with yourself for a few seconds, even if you're unsure. This ‘struggling’ with the memory is exactly the process that strengthens your neural connections (~~Active Recall: Techniques & Benefits | Vaia~~). If you can't remember the answer, don't see this as a failure, but as part of the learning process. Look it up and try again next time. According to research, this active recall significantly increases retention (~~Active Recall: Techniques & Benefits | Vaia~~). Even if you remember something incorrectly, you will learn more from it than if you had just read what is correct.

**Spaced Repetition** is all about the question: *when to* repeat? Scientists agree: the interval should be short at the beginning and then get longer and longer (~~Spaced repetition – Wikipedia~~). In practice, this means that you learn new or difficult cards at the beginning of each day, then every 2 days, then every 5 days, etc. – depending on how well you can remember them. This staggered repetition is based on the *spacing effect*, which Ebbinghaus discovered in the 19th century (~~Spaced Repetition – Wikipedia~~). The Leitner method for paper cards implements it in a simple way, for example by reviewing cards in tray 1 daily, tray 2 every 2 days, and tray 3 weekly (~~Learning card index – Wikipedia~~). Digital apps calculate the exact intervals even more precisely and individually. What is important for you is **regularity**. It is more effective to study for 30 minutes every day than to study for 3.5 hours at a stretch once a week. This way, your brain stays in ‘training mode’ and what you have learned moves into long-term memory instead of disappearing after a short time.

A practical tip: **mix old and new cards.** When you start today, you will only have new cards. But in a few days you will have a stack of ‘old’ cards that you will need to repeat, while new ones are added. Make sure you have a good mix in your learning sessions. Learning only new cards is exhausting and not very sustainable without repetition; just repeating old cards does not give you a sense of progress. A healthy mix could be: 10 minutes of adding/studying new cards at the beginning, then 20 minutes of repetition from the system (whether analogue or app-driven). This way, your knowledge grows organically and what you have already learned is consolidated.

A little more about the **forgetting curve**: Ebbinghaus' experiments drastically showed how quickly you forget without repetition (~~forgetting curve – Wikipedia~~). Within 24 hours, more than half is lost, and after a week, only ~20% is partially remembered (~~forgetting curve – Wikipedia~~). This should not discourage you, but motivate you to *stick with it*. Imagine your brain is a bucket with a slightly perforated bottom – the water (knowledge) slowly runs out, but every time you repeat, you refill the water and the holes get smaller. After enough repetitions, most of the water stays in. Visualise this when your inner piggyback comes.

(~~image~~) *The forgetting curve according to Ebbinghaus: Without repetition (red curve), the level of knowledge decreases exponentially. With each repetition, the curve ‘jumps’ back up and the decline becomes flatter. Spaced Repetition aims to repeat at exactly the right moment to catch the decline.* (~~Forgetting curve - Wikipedia~~)

What does that mean in practice? Plan fixed repetitions. For example: Everything you learn today, you look at again tomorrow (24 hours later), then after three days, after a week, after two weeks. Stick to it roughly – apps can help you with planning, but if you learn in analogue form, keep a learning calendar. Mark: ‘Repeat topic X in a week.’ Spaced repetition requires discipline, but it pays off. From a learning psychology perspective, it greatly enhances the **quality of memory** in your brain (~~What is the evidence around spaced repetition | SC Training~~).

Another aspect is **interleaving** (mixed learning). It can be helpful not to stubbornly study cards on a single topic, but to change topics in between. This forces your brain to think more flexibly. For example, you can alternate between two subjects when repeating (first 5 maths cards, then 5 history cards, then maths again, etc.). This approach prevents monotony and helps you to master the knowledge independently of context.

Finally, **be patient with yourself.** Spaced repetition sometimes seems unspectacular because you feel like you ‘already know it, why learn it again’. But it is precisely these repetitions over a long period of time that are the key. Trust the process – science and countless testimonials confirm that it works (~~What is the evidence around spaced repetition | SC Training~~). Active recall and spacing are like a workout for your brain: lifting dumbbells once won't do much, but regular training will make you strong. Likewise, regular flashcard sessions will make you an expert in your field!

## **Learning styles and flashcards: find your personal style**

Everyone learns a little differently. We often speak of **different learning styles** – typically, we distinguish between the visual, auditory, kinaesthetic and communicative learning styles. In reality, we are usually a mixture of all of these, but it doesn't hurt to know your own preferences and adapt the flashcard method accordingly.

**Visual learners:** Do you remember things best when you see them? Then your flashcards should be as *visually rich* as possible. Use colours, drawings, symbols. If it fits the topic, insert images on the cards – such as a diagram, a graphic or a photo. Even highlighting important terms on the answer page in colour can help you to visualise this image the next time you revise. Some people also consciously write **in a spatial manner on the paper**, e.g. always writing key terms in the top right-hand corner of the card – this can help your memory (keyword: *method of loci*). Digitally, you can incorporate emojis or icons to tag information. Visual elements make learning more tangible for you. Another tip: always visualise an image when answering a flashcard question. Our brain remembers images more easily than abstract text.

**Auditory learners:** Do you learn well by hearing? Then **say your flashcards out loud**! Read the question out loud, think about it, then say the answer before turning to check yourself. This may be difficult in the library, but maybe you can find a place (your room, a walk alone) where you can quiz yourself out loud. Alternatively, you can ask your study partners for help: Let someone quiz you and answer orally. Digitally, some apps offer the possibility to create *audio flashcards* – you could, for example, record the answer and play it, or use text-to-speech (Quizlet and other flashcard apps have voice functions that read the text to you). Another option is to listen to cards as an audio learning list, e.g. during car journeys. It is important that you use the auditory channel: you may later remember how you pronounced the answer, and that is precisely what gives you the necessary clue.

**Kinaesthetic learners:** Do you need movement and ‘tangible’ things when learning? Then physical flashcards are almost a must for you. As mentioned above, writing by hand is a form of movement that improves learning (~~learning myths: Does writing by hand make you smarter?~~). In addition, you could walk around while reviewing, placing the cards in different places in your room (e.g. definitions of terms on the wall, formulas on the mirror – a change of location can work wonders). Some kinesthetic learners develop little rituals: for example, they throw cards they know into one box (the feeling of *throwing something away* signals to the brain ‘done!’) and unknown cards into another. You can also use your hands to recreate terms or associate them with gestures. Sounds crazy, but the more of your body that is involved, the more areas of your brain will store the information. **Educational games** are also great: make a board game with flashcards or use apps that have a game element (Quizlet Live or Kahoot with cards). Exercise and learning don't have to be a contradiction – on the contrary, research shows that moderate physical activity can improve memory.

**Communicative (or reading/writing) learners:** Some learn best by explaining or discussing. If you find that you only really understand something when you tell it to someone else, then use index cards as a basis for conversation. Get together with fellow students and quiz each other – but also talk about the answers. Explain aloud why the answer is correct and provide additional information. This *learning by teaching* really helps to consolidate knowledge. If you don't have a partner, you can also answer out loud to yourself as if you were explaining it to someone. Or write a short explanation in full sentences next to the answer on the card – the formulation is like a soliloquy on paper. Some learners keep a learning diary: after the flashcard sessions, they briefly write down which cards were difficult and why – this reflective writing process alone helps with memorisation.

Important: these learning types are not rigid categories. Try out different approaches and feel free to combine them. You might find that you are visual AND kinaesthetic – in which case you can draw little sketches on your handwritten cards. Or auditory and communicative: then record yourself explaining and listen to it later. Index cards provide you with a platform for integrating your preferred learning styles. Be creative!

One more thing: *learning with all the senses.* The more diverse the ways in which you engage with the material, the deeper it will be anchored. Index cards already cover a lot, but you can go beyond that: make a mind map on the topic (visual/kinaesthetic), tell your friend about it (auditory/communicative), find a video about it (visual/auditory) – and then use index cards again to review the core details. This is how you come full circle.

## **Conclusion: Creating flashcards – your key to long-term learning success**

Whether old-fashioned or high-tech, **flashcards** are and remain an ingeniously simple but extremely effective learning tool. In this article, we have seen how you can master the learning material with classic card boxes and the Leitner system or with modern apps and AI support. The important thing is to find the method that suits **you and your subject matter**. You may discover that a combination works well for you – the flexibility of digital cards and the anchoring provided by handwriting, the efficiency of AI-generated cards and the personal touch of your own revision.

Whatever you choose, keep the basic principles in mind: **active repetition, distributed learning, regular refreshing.**Flashcards are not an end in themselves, but a tool to implement precisely these learning psychology techniques. Used correctly, you can achieve amazing results – from perfect vocabulary knowledge to a deep understanding of complex subject content. And you don't have to study stubbornly and alone: modern tools enable collaborative learning, adaptation to your learning style and even time savings through AI.

Especially for students and pupils in German-speaking countries, where large amounts of material often have to be mastered in a short time (think of university exams or the Abitur), flashcards are ideal for making the **most of your study time**. The saying ‘study smarter, not harder’ can hardly be applied anywhere as well as here. A clever way of organising your flashcards, a little effort every day and the power of repetition – that's all you need to continuously build up your knowledge.

Finally, we'd like to motivate you: **just get started!** Grab a chapter, create 5 flashcards for it – whether it's with pen and paper or in your favourite app – and test it out. You won't have to wait long for the first successes. As soon as you realise that you can retrieve something you didn't know before thanks to your cards, your motivation will increase by itself. Learning can be fun and satisfying, and index cards are your companion on this journey. So go ahead: create your index cards and become the master of your knowledge! Good luck with your learning – you can do it!
