## How Tutor AI Works

**Tutor AI** is a cutting-edge learning tool that uses artificial intelligence to offer tailored support for homework, studying, and understanding difficult concepts. Unlike traditional tutoring services, **Tutor AI** doesn’t follow a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, it adapts to your learning style and preferences.

The first time you use **Tutor AI**, the platform analyzes your strengths and weaknesses through diagnostic assessments. It then creates a personalized learning path, focusing on areas where you need the most help. For example, if you’re struggling with algebra or chemistry, **Tutor AI** will dedicate more time and resources to those topics.

The tool also offers step-by-step solutions and explanations for problems you input. If you’re stuck on a math equation or a physics problem, **Tutor AI** breaks it down into digestible parts, guiding you through the process until you get the right answer.
