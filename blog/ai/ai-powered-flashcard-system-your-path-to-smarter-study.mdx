## How AI Enhances Flashcards

**Personalized Content Creation**: No more manual work. Your AI assistant scans your textbooks, notes, or PDFs, then creates flashcards keyed to your weaknesses and goals. It helps you target the material that truly matters.

**Adaptive Scheduling for Maximum Retention**: Don’t guess when to review. Our system uses the Forgetting Spaced Repetition System (FSRS). It reminds you to revisit information right before it slips from memory, reinforcing long-term recall and cutting wasted effort.

**Intelligent Feedback That Guides Your Learning**: AI sees beyond “correct” or “incorrect.” It examines your answers, identifies your trouble spots, and suggests further practice or clarifications. You’ll gain deeper insights and accelerate your progress.
